Hello dear YourControls fans

The B777 is now available for YourControls. I would like to point out once again that this is my first release and I have sacrificed my free time for it, so please be kind with your feedback.

If you find any bugs, please contact me on Discord: Dustin_22 or use this form: https://forms.gle/3P8HY8o8WYxb5tJKA

However, there are some bugs that are unfortunately beyond my control. Here are some listed:

- COMM/CHKL: The COMM/CHKL pages are unfortunately not implemented in the YourControls file. This is an error from the YourControls side. (Each pilot must fill out their own checklist to avoid error messages.)
- 
- Out of Sync: Since the B777 is provided with a .wasm file, it can sometimes happen that you are no longer synchronized with each other.
- 
- PMDG B777 Tablet: "Remove Chocks" must be set or removed by each pilot individually.

Additional:
- I recommend that you and your co-pilot first conduct a test flight to check if everything is working properly.
- Be sure that you both have the same Panel State
